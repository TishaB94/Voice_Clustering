# Voice_Clustering
This course project focuses on predicting the gender of a speaker (male/female) using a voice dataset with 46 extracted audio features. By leveraging ensemble learning techniques like Random Forest and a custom Power Boosting method, the model effectively classifies voices with improved accuracy and balanced distribution.
